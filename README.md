Elijjah is a high-level language suitable for replacement Java and C++. It is meant to
integrate into current C and Java projects. It will feature a REPL and a graphical environment as well, 
along the lines Smalltalk/Tunes Slate.

It is free software intended for use on all systems, including GNU/Linux.

Other Software Required:
  * antlr (included)
  * javassist (not used yet, but included)
  * python (not yet)
  * java-compiler (java8)
  
The repo is currently buildable from maven.  You can also import into Eclipse and IDEA
and get up and running.  The tests need to run run from the root directory, which is 
done automatically in maven but not IDEA.

Much work is needed.

See [Language Overview](docs/language-overview.md) for more details on the language.

All of this is a work in progress and your support would be appreciated.
